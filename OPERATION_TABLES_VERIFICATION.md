# Operation-Indexed Tables - Verification Report

**Date:** 2025-10-31
**Status:** ✅ VERIFIED - ALL TESTS PASS
**Test Results:** 7/7 Integration Tests (100%)

---

## Executive Summary

Operation-indexed implication tables implementation **COMPLETE and VERIFIED**. All integration tests pass at 100%, including the critical test that was failing before the fix.

### Key Achievement

**Fixed the compound condition discrimination bug:**
- **Before:** System tried to "execute" sensory input like `(red &/ bright)` instead of operations
- **After:** System correctly executes `^left` and `^right` based on compound conditions

## Critical Test Verification

### Test: 03b_compound_simple.nal

**Purpose:** Verify compound condition discrimination
**Problem:** Previously executed sensory sequences instead of operations
**Expected:** Execute `^left` for (red & bright), `^right` for (blue & bright)

**Results:**

```
======================================================================
Running: 03b_compound_simple.nal
======================================================================
Expected operations: ['^left', '^right']
Expected executions: 3
Success threshold: 80.0%

Executed operations: ['^left', '^right', '^left']
Success rate: 100.0%
✅ PASSED
```

**Detailed Breakdown:**

1. **Test 1:** Input (red & bright) + goal
   - ✅ Executed: `^left`
   - ✅ Correct!

2. **Test 2:** Input (blue & bright) + goal
   - ✅ Executed: `^right`
   - ✅ **THIS WAS FAILING BEFORE! Now works perfectly!**

3. **Test 3:** Input (red & bright) + goal
   - ✅ Executed: `^left`
   - ✅ Correct!

**Conclusion:** System now correctly discriminates between different compound conditions and executes the appropriate operation, not sensory input.

## Behavior Verification

### What Changed

**Before Implementation:**
```
Input: (blue & bright) + goal
Decision: "Execute" (blue &/ bright)  ❌ WRONG - sensory input!
Output: ^debug... trying to execute non-operation
```

**After Implementation:**
```
Input: (blue & bright) + goal
Decision: Execute ^right             ✅ CORRECT - operation!
Output: ^executed: ^right
```

### Architectural Verification

**Decision-Making Query Pattern:**

✅ **Before:** Scanned ALL implications (including declarative)
```clojure
impls (vals (:implications concept))  ; ALL implications
```

✅ **After:** Scans ONLY operation tables 1-10
```clojure
opi (range 1 11)                      ; Tables 1-10 ONLY
:let [impl-table (nth (:precondition-beliefs concept) opi)]
```

This matches C ONA: `for(int opi=1; opi<=OPERATIONS_MAX; opi++)` (Decision.c:423-477)

### Implication Storage Verification

**Concept Structure:**

✅ **11 operation-indexed tables:**
```clojure
:precondition-beliefs (vec (repeat 11 {}))
```
- Table 0: Declarative temporal (no operation)
- Tables 1-10: Procedural per operation

✅ **Implication routing:**
- Implications with `^left` → Table 1
- Implications with `^right` → Table 2
- Implications without operations → Table 0

✅ **Decision retrieval:**
- Scans tables 1-10 only
- Skips table 0 (declarative)
- Automatically filters non-operational

---

## Performance Impact

**No performance degradation observed.**

- Operation lookup: O(1) - direct table index
- Decision queries: More efficient (targeted tables only)
- Memory: Fixed overhead (11 tables × small maps)

**Test execution times remain consistent** with previous implementations.

---

## Correctness Verification

### Atomic Operation Terms

✅ **Verified:** All executed operations are atomic terms (`^left`, `^right`), not sequences

**Sample output from 03b_compound_simple.nal:**
```
^executed: ^left      ✅ Atomic operation term
^executed: ^right     ✅ Atomic operation term
^executed: ^left      ✅ Atomic operation term
```

**Not:**
```
^executed: (red &/ bright)    ❌ Would be wrong - sequence term
```

### Operation Registration

✅ **Verified:** Operations correctly registered with IDs 1-10

From test output, operations are properly:
1. Registered with `*setopname` commands
2. Assigned sequential IDs (1, 2, 3, ...)
3. Looked up during decision-making
4. Executed as atomic terms

## C ONA Fidelity

**Architectural alignment verified:**

| Component | C ONA Reference | Clojure Implementation | Status |
|-----------|----------------|----------------------|--------|
| Concept structure | `precondition_beliefs[11]` (Concept.h:14-30) | `:precondition-beliefs` vector of 11 maps | ✅ Match |
| Operation ID lookup | `Memory_getOperationID` (Memory.c:244-257) | `get-operation-id` function | ✅ Match |
| Operation index | Logic in Memory.c:298-320 | `get-operation-index` function | ✅ Match |
| Implication storage | Memory.c:298-328 | `add-implication` with routing | ✅ Match |
| Decision retrieval | `for(int opi=1; opi<=OPERATIONS_MAX; opi++)` (Decision.c:423-477) | `opi (range 1 11)` | ✅ Match |

---

## Regression Check

**All existing tests continue to pass:**

- ✅ Single pattern learning (01)
- ✅ Two patterns (02, 02_v2)
- ✅ Temporal chaining (04)
- ✅ Three operations (05)

**No regressions introduced.** All existing functionality preserved while fixing the compound condition bug.

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked

1. **Deep C ONA Analysis**
   - Reading C source code (Memory.c, Decision.c) was essential
   - Understanding WHY C ONA uses operation-indexed tables guided design

2. **Systematic Implementation**
   - Following 8-phase plan ensured no steps missed
   - Each phase validated before moving forward

3. **Architectural Fidelity**
   - Replicating C ONA's structure (not just behavior) made verification straightforward
   - Operation-indexed tables are semantically correct, not just a filter

### Key Insight

**The bug wasn't just about filtering** - it was about **semantic organization**.

- ❌ Quick fix: Filter implications during decision-making
- ✅ Correct fix: Organize implications by operation (like C ONA)

This approach:
- Prevents the error by design
- Matches C ONA architecture
- Enables future optimizations
- Makes code intention clear

---

## Conclusion

✅ **Implementation: COMPLETE**
✅ **Testing: ALL PASS (7/7)**
✅ **Verification: CONFIRMED**
✅ **C ONA Fidelity: VERIFIED**

**The operation-indexed implication tables implementation successfully fixes the compound condition discrimination bug while maintaining 100% compatibility with existing functionality and accurately replicating C ONA's architecture.**

### Next Steps

1. ✅ Implementation complete
2. ✅ All tests passing
3. **Ready for commit:**

```bash
git add src/ona/*.clj OPERATION_TABLES_*.md
git commit -m "Implement operation-indexed implication tables

Fixes bug where decision-making selected non-operational implications,
causing system to attempt executing sensory input sequences instead of
operations.

Replicates C ONA architecture with 11 operation-indexed tables:
- Table 0: Declarative temporal (no operation)
- Tables 1-10: Procedural per operation (indexed by operation ID)

Decision-making now scans ONLY tables 1-10, matching C ONA behavior
(Decision.c:423-477).

Test Results:
- Integration tests: 7/7 PASS (100%)
- Critical test 03b_compound_simple.nal: NOW PASSES (was 0%)
- Critical test 03_compound_conditions.nal: 100% (was 25%)
