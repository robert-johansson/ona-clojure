// Test: Decision making through temporal implication
// Scenario: Learn <key-pressed =/> door-opened>, then want door-opened!
//
// Flow:
// 1. Observe: key-pressed at t=10
// 2. Observe: door-opened at t=20
// 3. System learns: <key-pressed =/> door-opened>
// 4. Goal: door-opened!
// 5. System should decide: high desire for implication

// Step 1: Learn the temporal implication
<key --> pressed>. :|: {1.0 0.9}
10
<door --> opened>. :|: {1.0 0.9}
5

// Check that implication was formed

// Step 2: Establish belief that key is pressed NOW
*currenttime=50
<key --> pressed>. :|: {1.0 0.9}

// Step 3: Add goal for door to be opened
<door --> opened>! :|: {1.0 0.9}

// Execute cycles - should trigger decision making
