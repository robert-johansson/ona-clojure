Comment:  Test: Decision making through temporal implication
Comment:  Scenario: Learn <key-pressed =/> door-opened>, then want door-opened!
Comment: 
Comment:  Flow:
Comment:  1. Observe: key-pressed at t=10
Comment:  2. Observe: door-opened at t=20
Comment:  3. System learns: <key-pressed =/> door-opened>
Comment:  4. Goal: door-opened!
Comment:  5. System should decide: high desire for implication
Comment:  Step 1: Learn the temporal implication
Input: <key --> pressed>. :|: occurrenceTime=12 Priority=1.000000 Stamp=[1] Truth: frequency=1.000000, confidence=0.900000
Selected: <key --> pressed>. :|: occurrenceTime=12 Priority=1.000000 Stamp=[1] Truth: frequency=1.000000, confidence=0.900000
performing 10 inference steps:
done with 10 additional inference steps.
Input: <door --> opened>. :|: occurrenceTime=23 Priority=1.000000 Stamp=[2] Truth: frequency=1.000000, confidence=0.900000
Selected: <door --> opened>. :|: occurrenceTime=23 Priority=1.000000 Stamp=[2] Truth: frequency=1.000000, confidence=0.900000
Derived: dt=11.000000 <<key --> pressed> =/> <door --> opened>>. Priority=0.177509 Stamp=[1,2] Truth: frequency=1.000000, confidence=0.061079
performing 5 inference steps:
done with 5 additional inference steps.
