Comment:  Test: Sequence formation from consecutive temporal events
Comment:  Input: a at time 10, b at time 20
Comment:  Expected: System should derive sequence (a &/ b)
Comment:  Input first event at time 10
Input: <a --> event>. :|: occurrenceTime=12 Priority=1.000000 Stamp=[1] Truth: frequency=1.000000, confidence=0.900000
Selected: <a --> event>. :|: occurrenceTime=12 Priority=1.000000 Stamp=[1] Truth: frequency=1.000000, confidence=0.900000
Comment:  Advance to time 20
performing 10 inference steps:
done with 10 additional inference steps.
Comment:  Input second event at time 20
Input: <b --> event>. :|: occurrenceTime=25 Priority=1.000000 Stamp=[2] Truth: frequency=1.000000, confidence=0.900000
Selected: <b --> event>. :|: occurrenceTime=25 Priority=1.000000 Stamp=[2] Truth: frequency=1.000000, confidence=0.900000
Derived: dt=13.000000 <<a --> $1> =/> <b --> $1>>. Priority=0.173772 Stamp=[1,2] Truth: frequency=1.000000, confidence=0.040889
Derived: dt=13.000000 <<a --> event> =/> <b --> event>>. Priority=0.173772 Stamp=[1,2] Truth: frequency=1.000000, confidence=0.040889
Comment:  Execute cycles to process and derive sequence
performing 5 inference steps:
done with 5 additional inference steps.
Comment:  Check concepts - should show a, b, and (a &/ b)
