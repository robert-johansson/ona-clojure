Comment:  Test: Basic Temporal Reasoning (NAL 7)
Comment:  Tests: Concept creation, temporal events, sequence formation
Comment: 
Comment:  Expected behavior:
Comment:  - Create concepts for 'a' and 'b'
Comment:  - Form temporal sequence (a &/ b)
Comment:  - Learn temporal implication <a =/> b>
Comment:  Input first temporal event
Input: <a --> x>. :|: occurrenceTime=2 Priority=1.000000 Stamp=[1] Truth: frequency=1.000000, confidence=0.900000
Selected: <a --> x>. :|: occurrenceTime=2 Priority=1.000000 Stamp=[1] Truth: frequency=1.000000, confidence=0.900000
performing 1 inference steps:
done with 1 additional inference steps.
Comment:  Input second temporal event (should form sequence)
Input: <b --> y>. :|: occurrenceTime=5 Priority=1.000000 Stamp=[2] Truth: frequency=1.000000, confidence=0.900000
Selected: <b --> y>. :|: occurrenceTime=5 Priority=1.000000 Stamp=[2] Truth: frequency=1.000000, confidence=0.900000
Derived: dt=3.000000 <<a --> x> =/> <b --> y>>. Priority=0.215524 Stamp=[1,2] Truth: frequency=1.000000, confidence=0.226692
performing 10 inference steps:
done with 10 additional inference steps.
Comment:  Capture state after sequence formation
