Comment:  Test: Temporal induction to learn implications
Comment:  Input: a at time 10, b at time 30
Comment:  Expected: System should derive <a =/> b> with offset=20
Comment:  Input first event at time 10
Input: <precondition --> x>. :|: occurrenceTime=12 Priority=1.000000 Stamp=[1] Truth: frequency=1.000000, confidence=0.900000
Selected: <precondition --> x>. :|: occurrenceTime=12 Priority=1.000000 Stamp=[1] Truth: frequency=1.000000, confidence=0.900000
Comment:  Advance to time 30
performing 20 inference steps:
done with 20 additional inference steps.
Comment:  Input second event at time 30
Input: <postcondition --> y>. :|: occurrenceTime=35 Priority=1.000000 Stamp=[2] Truth: frequency=1.000000, confidence=0.900000
Selected: <postcondition --> y>. :|: occurrenceTime=35 Priority=1.000000 Stamp=[2] Truth: frequency=1.000000, confidence=0.900000
Comment:  Execute cycles to derive implication
